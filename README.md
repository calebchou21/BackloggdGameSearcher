# About

This is a simple and relatively useless script that scrapes backloggd.com for information about video games. If anything, the get random game feature is pretty fun though an
d could be useful for finding new random games. I really just developed this in order to learn a bit about web scraping. Looking back at my code now, it is definitely not structured very well and could definitely be cleaned up and organized.
It works though!
